# Steveo Platformer — Phase 3 Overnight Run — Decisions Log

Started 2026-07-01. Records assumptions/decisions made during the Phase 3 master-brief run.
Q0 verified: Phase 3B (`players[]`, PvP hit detection, kill attribution, Friendly Fire, Deathmatch)
is committed (`91176fa`) and complete in code. CTF still `comingSoon`. Building on top of it.

## Up-front answers from user (2026-07-01)

### Q1 — Spawn Point System
- **Player Spawn Points are DISTINCT from Survival "Spawn Lines"** (which spawn mobs). New concept.
- All arena games require one player spawn point per supported player count.
- Spawn points are a **sandbox-placeable item** (movable + deletable), NOT hard-coded.
- Auto-migration: **pre-populate 2 spawn points** into each arena map. 3rd/4th are designer-added.
- On save, **warn how many players the map currently supports** (= number of placed spawn points, capped 4).
- Fallback: if making them auto-created-yet-still-deletable/movable proves risky, switch to **flag-only**
  (don't auto-create; just warn/block until a designer places them). Decision on which path taken is
  logged below once implemented.

### Q2 — CTF spawn points
- **4 total, 2 per team** (2v2 max), consistent with the engine's 4-player hard cap.

### Q4 — KOTH contested-zone scoring
- Default = user's **"sticky ownership"** rule: a player gains ownership only when they are the *sole*
  toucher; they keep it until a *different sole* toucher takes it; if 2+ players touch at once, ownership
  does NOT change (owner can hunt others without losing the hill).
- Add a **pre-launch KOTH scoring selector** with three options:
  1. Sticky ownership (DEFAULT — the rule above)
  2. Sole-occupant-only scoring (no one scores while contested)
  3. All-occupants score (everyone in the zone accrues)

### Q5 — Theme persistence
- **Client-side localStorage** per browser (no server schema this pass).

## Logged assumptions (not asked)

### Q3 — Slot assignment strategy
- Spawn points carry a designer-assigned number (1–4). At match start, players are assigned to
  spawn points in ascending number order; unnumbered/extra spawns fall back to join order.

## Implementation decisions

### Spawn Point System (Task 1) — DONE for arena
- Path chosen: **auto-create** (not flag-only). The seeded spawn points are ordinary placed
  objects in `sandbox.placedSpawnPoints`, fully movable + deletable via the same click/popup
  flow as Spawn Lines — so the movable/deletable requirement is satisfied; no fallback needed.
- New sandbox placeable `kind: 'spawnpoint'` (blue flag/banner marker with player #), distinct
  from the purple Survival "Spawn Line" swirl. Cap 4; each carries `slot` 1–4.
- Persisted under world-data key **`playerSpawns`** (distinct from mob `spawnPoints`).
- Arena consumption: `_setupArena` prefers built-in map `m.playerSpawns[i]`, then editor-placed
  spawn point with `slot===i+1` (else i-th by slot order), then legacy auto-spread fallback.
- Auto-migration: `_seedDefaultSpawnPoints()` seeds 2 (slots 1,2) near the level start whenever a
  loaded world has none. Old worlds keep working; designers add #3/#4 for 3–4P maps.
- Save-time warning: `_arenaSettingsWarnings` reports supported player count (0 → auto-start note;
  <4 → "supports up to N"; 4 → full).
- **Partial/deferred:** non-arena modes (Story/Sandbox/God/Speedrunner) still use the world's own
  `spawnX/spawnY` for the player start — spawn point #1 is placed/persisted but does not yet
  override those single-player start positions (low-risk deferral; arena is the primary need for
  KOTH/CTF). Editor shows/persists the points in all modes.

### KOTH 4-player PvP (Task 2) — DONE
- KOTH state generalized from `holdP1/holdP2` to a `hold{p1..p4}` map; ownership + accrual now
  work for 1–4 players. Verified with a 23-assertion headless test against the real arena-modes.js.
- Scoring rule selectable in pre-launch (`cfg.kothScoring`): STICKY (default) / SOLE / ALL — exactly
  as the user described. Single-player keeps the tuned "accrue only while standing" behaviour.
- Friendly Fire defaults ON (unlocked) for KOTH so it plays as a PvP contest; kills flow through the
  existing 3B attribution (counts toward stats). Uncheck FF for a no-combat race.
- HUD shows CONTESTED + per-player times; hill tint extended to P3 green / P4 yellow / contested white.
- Bugfix: `_ownerIds` now derives from `activePlayers()` instead of the legacy `player2?2:1`
  heuristic — corrects Deathmatch leader/HUD for 3–4 players too.

### Phase 3C — CTF + Teams (Task 3) — DONE (playable), one editor tool deferred
- New `js/ctf-system.js` (mirrors emerald/powerup system pattern): flag grab / carry / drop-on-death /
  teammate-return / auto-return (15s = 900 frames) / capture (50 pts). Verified with a 17-assertion
  headless test against the real code.
- Teams: 2 teams, players alternate by index → 2P = 1v1, 4P = P1&P3 (Red) vs P2&P4 (Blue). Team
  assignment + colours set in `CTF_SYSTEM.assignTeams`; `p.teamId`/`p.teamColor` (reserved in 3B) now used.
- **Team-aware friendly fire** added to the arrow PvP in mobs.js: teammates never damage each other
  (guarded by `teamId != null`, so it's a no-op for FFA Deathmatch/KotH). FF forced on for CTF.
- CTF win/score/HUD/winner wired in arena-modes.js; `CAPTURE_FLAG` un-greyed (no longer comingSoon).
- Pre-launch: "Captures to Win" slider (`cfg.captureTarget`, default 3); FF locked on with teammate note.
- Also fixed an adjacent 4-player bug: `_updateArenaCollectibles` now awards emerald pickups to ALL
  active players (P3/P4 were previously skipped).
- **Deferred (documented gap vs brief §4.3):** explicit *flag-placement design tool* in the editor.
  Instead, flag home bases **auto-anchor to each team's player spawn points** (falling back to map
  quarters). This makes CTF fully playable without a new editor placeable; an explicit flag tool can be
  added later using the same placeable pattern as Player Spawn Points if designers want custom bases.
  Per the brief's CTF spawn decision, teams use 2 spawn points per side (2v2 max).
